      "Mike Martin Media is an multi media production company based in St Louis, Missouri and working all around the world. When I first began working with MMM they had an old WordPress website that was not meeting their needs. Our first order of business was to stabilize the old website. After that I worked with them to design and develop a new website, custom made to fit their specific needs. The biggest challenge was working with a large amount of video content. They needed a website to showcase their work for potential clients. Video files are big and not always easy to work with. I was able to optimize the website to load quickly and display the video content in a way that was easy to navigate and view. The website is fully responsive and looks great on any device. It features a sortable video gallery, embedded video content, a blog, and a contact form. The website is integrated with Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager for running ads and monitoring site traffic. Cookie consent management is handled with Cookie Yes.",
